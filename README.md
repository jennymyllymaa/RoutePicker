# RoutePicker
A mobile app for a Flutter course.

## About  

RoutePicker is a Flutter mobile app that generates running and walking routes using the Google Maps API. The app detects the user's location, asks for a preferred distance, and generates six possible routes (The route generating alcorythm is not my work and it does not always work perfectly. It is adapted from **ChatGPT and StackOverflow**, utilizing trigonometry and Earth's radius calculations. This school project was to practise mobile app development). Users can also save their weight to estimate calorie consumption. Once a route is selected, users can start a stopwatch while tracking their progress on the map. A blue marker represents the user's location.  

## Features  

- **Route Generation**: Creates six different routes based on the user's location and desired distance.  
- **Calorie Estimation**: Estimates calorie burn based on user weight.  
- **Live Tracking**: Displays a blue marker to show the user's current position.  
- **Stopwatch**: Allows users to time their workout sessions.  
- **Light Theme**: Optional light mode for better visibility.
